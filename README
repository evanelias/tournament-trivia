/source/trivia
    Source for Tournament Trivia. Apologies for the awful tab-stops and odd

    Please fork this and reformat!

    Same horrible indentation practices as the trivia source, I'm afraid :)

About Tournament Trivia:

Players compete  with each other in real-time, trying to be the first to answer
the current question.  Scores add up from day to day, and are reset at the end
of the month, with one player emerging victorious. Excellent multi-node support
that also functions as a chat room.  

Runs on Synchronet, as well as any Windows-based BBS software that supports
DOOR32.SYS (Winserver, Mystic, EleBBS, and GameSrv)



About ObjectDoor:

This is an engine I wrote for building Win32 multiuser doorgames.  It makes
multiuser BBS games substantially easier to write by passing all major game
functionality to a background process, which is communicated with via Win32
Mailslots for its IPC mechanism.  It uses multithreading extensively.

It can build executables for either the Synchronet XSDK or the OpenDoors 
doorkit -- link the appropriate one in when compiling.

In 2003-04 I started work on a version of Intrnode that builds a single
executable supporting both doorkits, and I also started Linux and FreeBSD
ports of the software.  Neither were completed, but if I can dig them up,
I'll release them as a branch.



Compiling:

All code was originally compiled on Borland C++ 5.  With modern compilers, YMMV.
